# TAKING TREE

*final project for ART265*

### Project Proposal
*4/26/23*
> *For this final project, I would like to iterate on a previous project. I enjoyed and felt proud about my Intersection body horror tree so after discussing it I decided to implement it in a VR/Game environment. There were a few options that I thought about, Unity, WebGL, and A-frame. Unity and WebGL would be extremely beneficial in making a game environment, enabling conditionals, and would give a user control of a character. However, both of these options are time-consuming and aren’t accessible to everyone. A frame on the other hand can be accessed on any device which makes it the winning candidate for this project. Although it’s more limited than Unity and WebGL, A-frame allows for glTF uploads and VR capabilities.
> Before implementing the VR I will make sure that the body horror tree is as polished as possible. Making it a bit low poly and cleaning up any seams. Then implementing a site using A-Frame will allow a user to interact with the horror tree.
> A challenge that I may encounter is definitely making it more than just a VR experience. Meaning making it more than just a visual experience, I would like the user to do a chopping action and take damage. I’ve never done that with A-frame before, so it presents an interesting challenge.*
